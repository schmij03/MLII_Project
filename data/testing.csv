0,1.0,"I actually received this gift.  half of it was inedible (processed brie cheese?  seriously?) and the rest was a low-quality product in fancy packaging (honey-roasted peanuts?).  it is totally absurd to pay $50, let alone $20.  if this had been the package of food you paid $5 for as an ""in-flight meal"" i'd have been disappointed.  you could do *much* better at whole foods with a $20 bill.",-1

4,1.0,"I've tried a lot of brands of coconut water, and have found that I like Zico pure coconut water the best. It has a clean refreshing taste that's not too overpowering. The 11oz boxes are what I normally drink.<br /><br />This product(14oz bottles) cannot compare to the box. The tast is absolutely horrible. Way too thick and sugary. It's almost as if they drained a bunch of old coconuts that had been sitting too long. I would advise anybody who enjoys the 11oz box to stick with that and stay away from this joke of a product. Nasty.",-1

9,1.0,"Is it possible that culinary great Wolfgang Puck would lend his name to such a mediocre food product? If you buy this sauce, you'll find your answer and that answer is yes. I highly doubt that Wolfgang Puck actually tasted this sauce before he signed the contract to attach his name and likeness to this insipid product but with the other Wolfgang Puck food products I've tried lately I'm starting to see a trend. If you're going to buy this sauce anyway, just go to the local market and buy one jar to try it out.",-1

13,1.0,"I had previously purchased the chicken and the duck from this line so I wanted to try the beef liver.<br />Well, my dog likes the flavor but I don't like how dry they are. They have very sharp edges and I had to be creative to soften them a bit so that my dog wouldn't suffer from a rapture in the esophagus while eating them as they are. The other 2 (chicken + duck) are a little chewer than this one. I would not buy this again unless texture improves.",-1

17,1.0,"I agree with the review that states this tea is watery. The taste of the spices is also almost minimal, with a faintly medicinal quality.

20,1.0,"These things taste so bad, I could not find anyone in my office who would finish one ON A BET!  They are absolutely foul.  I can't for the life of me figure out how any company would have put these on the market.  when you open them, they smell like pudding, which is a good thing except for when you actually taste them and then you feel like you've been tricked.  They have almost no taste, and the texture of melted plastic.  Another way to describe them is that it is like easting grease, except I think eating grease might be better.  And don't think the chocolate ones will be marginally better.  Snack Pack, shame on you.",-1
21,1.0,"This restaurant provides a perfect way to waste your money on fine dining. Been there on my friend's birthday party and liked none of their dishes. The panner tikka had so hard paneer that even fork was finding it difficult to split it into pieces. The main course dishes were no different. kadai chicken, dal makhani, paneer lababdar were very average and I found it hugely overpriced. To add to these, the sitting area is not comfortable at all. I did not get a chance to sit on chairs. The service further was not a saver. The service is very slow and waiters are pretty arrogant. The manager too defends the actions of its staff rather than accepting the mistakes and apologising. Its simple for me. Would not choose this anytime in future.",-1
22,1.0,I purchased this item by looking at the picture and reviews.I had been searching for an all banana container. The picture shows banana laffy taffy and the reviews mention how much the buyer loves banana laffy taffy. I was quite surprised to get a container of assorted laffy taffy. I hate all flavors of laffy taffy except banana. I won't buy from this seller again because of the questionable representation in their advertisement.,-1
23,1.0,"maybe you'd like this.  I thought it was terrible, and am looking to give it all away.  I don't know why I ordered it - and the same for the ""Chocolate Donut"" type - because I don't really like flavored coffee, and ESPECIALLY when the flavors all taste alike and the coffee is so weak it tastes like dishwater.

28,1.0,"I agree with most of the reviewers in this review.  I too have bought Premium Saltines all my life (I'm now 63) and they are now:  1. flimsy - will break in half or in pieces when spreading with peanut butter, 2.  poorly packaged - have many broken crackers in each tube which as another reviewer pointed out is due to flimsier cardboard packaging, and most importantly 3. have virtually no taste any more.  It is indeed a sad day that one of our old standbys has fallen victim to cost-cutting to enhance company profits.  Thanks to the reviewer about Keebler crackers....I'm switching.",-1

30,1.0,"After seeing the girls that started the business on Shark Tank I wanted to support them and also I LOVE peanut butter so I ordered the 5 pack special they were running at the time.<br /><br />I had a tasting party with a bunch of friends all looking forward to trying all the flavors.<br /><br />Not one person liked the product or was even able to swallow it after putting it in their mouth.  The taste was so bad and the greasy texture such a turn off that my guests were actually spitting the peanut butter into napkins.<br /><br />I called the company and was told that the product needed to be refrigerated and then STIRRED. I has already stirred the peanut butter when we opened the containers due to the oils being on the top, which is normal with natural peanut butters. Seriously stirring cold peanut butter is not possible, nor can it be spread on bread.<br /><br />Save your money - I am out over $60 for the Wild Squirrel Nut Butters and they all had to be thrown out.<br /><br />These girls said all their friends at college love the nut butters, too bad your friends didn't tell you the truth and save you and my guess is your parents loads of money getting this product to market.",-1

32,1.0,"I bought this coffee when someone wrote it was almost as good as Starbuck's French Roast high test.  It was not even close.  Comparing the grounds, Starbucks was a dark brown (as in dark roast), while Jeremiah's was a medium-light brown.  After trying to get used to it by using 1/2 the bag, I decided to email the company (as it said on the bag - money back guarentee) to ask for my money back for the two remaining bags which I would have been happy to send to them. They responded by saying I should take it up with Amazon.  Not real good customer service for a small company trying to get larger.  Needless to say, I won't be buying any coffee from them in the future.  I read some place that one unsatisfied customer can lose a business 25 customers.  We'll see.  I have since bought some Trader Joes Decaf French Roast (in the soft bag, not the round container).  It wasn't as good as Starbucks high test, but it was fair superior to Jeremiah's.",-1

34,1.0,"this seemed like one of the more higher end dog food since it cost twice as much as the dog food I got the first time I got my shelter dog.. She's a terrier mix (my vet tells me terriers are picky with food? I'm not entirely sure being a first-time dog owner), so I'm trying out different dog food that she'll like.. I saw great rating on this dog food, so I tried giving it a go, but she barely eats any! She'll only eat about a quarter of a cup an entire day, and start eating the grass outside when I take her out... I fed her the indoor mini dog royal canin stuff before, and that one smelled much nicer like a can of tuna (which made her poop smell nicer) and she actually ate her portions when I gave that to her. I was just hoping if I was going to spend that much money on dog food, I might as well find her the best one for her, but this one is a total miss.<br /><br />I might give another brand besides royal canin a try (since it's so expensive...), but I'm going to stay away from the taste of the wild...",-1

38,1.0,"We ordered two calzones this Sunday night. We specified regular, as opposed to medium for both. When the food arrived (over 1 hour late), they gave us one regular and one medium. I have no idea how such a stupid mistake could have been made. They could have easily recovered this by doing what any other professional food service establishment would have done, and charged us for the regular, as we had originally asked. The manager argued with us, and finally out of spite, told us that he would send his delivery guy back (who had run out the door at this point), and deliver us a regular. he didn't even offer to refund the money that he owed us for the mistake.

39,1.0,"These are the first treats I had purchased for our new puppy after reading several reviews on Amazon.  He'd only been home a few days and we were trying to reward him for going potty outside - these treats were completely counteractive.  The first night after starting the treats, his stools became very runny and he made many messes in the house.  We continued to give him the treats for another three days as we didn't realize the connection - his stools hardened the day after we stopped using these treats and he can now hold it and go outside!  He's been doing MUCH better on other puppy treats (went to PetCo for them) and I'm so thankful the runny poo messes are no longer a threat to my barefoot family.<br />Puppy is a 10 week old Staffordshire Terrier.",-1

46,1.0,"I visited Tamra with my cousins and ordered a meal for 5. We were very disappointed by the service and hygiene.  The in-house kitchen was poorly ventilated and sea-food stink filled a whole section of the restaurant. We requested them to seat us in a different section of the restaurant but they declined our request stating that all tables are reserved, when I could clearly spot a couple of tables without a 'reserved' placard.  They brought us drinks for one person at a time. For a Mojito we had to wait for 45mins and request it 3 times. The beer was served in a glass with a dead bug inside it. Almost an hour after placing the order our food arrived…. and they messed that up too! They forgot to prepare one of our dishes. The taste of some dishes was average while others were below average. The bill was for 15000 INR (approx. 230 USD). For that amount a good service and hygiene is to be expected. We even called for the manager but he did not show up! In short if you want below average tasting food at a highly marked up price with terrible service and poor hygiene you can eat at Tamra. We were all very disappointed by our experience there and would NOT recommend Tamra to anyone.",-1

49,1.0,"I've made it a mission to find a plush dog toy that will last for more than a day or two.  I became very excited when I read the description for this dog toy - layers and layers of material and rows upon rows of stitching.  My dog is not a chewer, but he does like to shake his toys while he's playing with them.  This one lasted less than 10 minutes before his front canine tooth went right through one of the legs.  It was all over after that.  I have to say though, the stitching does seem to be very good around the edges and if you have a dog that likes to chew the arms and legs, ears and noses off of his toys, this may hold up for a little while.  However, when a company uses words like 'extreme durability' and 'world's tuffest dog toy', I base my purchases on those descriptions- especially when buying on the Internet.

Though we requested for changing the table but none was available. As expected, waiter was not easily accessible in this corner during the course of our dining. Buffet was quite expensive for external guests (mostly suited for inhouse guests as they get it as part of room package). Spread was disappointingly average...starting from starters. Main course did not excite either. Breads that were served (roti & naan) on the table were not hot and took time to arrive.

After my dog has one, he's constantly trying to get the caked treat off of his back molars.  It sticks on pretty hard.  I have to help or I have to brush his teeth to get rid of it.  This can't be good for his teeth, and I don't know if he needs the extra sweetness in his diet.  I would recommend Old Mother Hubbard wheat-free treats, such as chicken and apples, before this.

The packaging for one case had a bit of a dent on one corner, but the other one had pristine packaging and still had dents in over half the cans. I contacted Amazon and they gave me a partial refund for the cans that were unusable.

70,2.0,"Decided to try out Rajdhani in CP recently after having eaten at the one in Gurgaon a couple of years ago, where my experience had been fairly positive. This one, however, turned out to be quite the opposite.  Firstly, we almost didn't make it, because the staff member managing their phone calls kept insisting that Rajdhani was in the inner CP circle (which it isn’t), but finally CP’s parking attendants managed to help us get there. Once in, we were shown to the mezzanine floor, which half of us weren’t able to walk through without stooping, because the ceiling is actually a few inches short of 6 ft. high! Overall, the place looks bedraggled, and manages to kill a little bit of your appetite before you start your meal.  I liked some of the touches like the surai and bowl for washing hands on the table, but, umm, ok, that was the only nice touch. The service staff was highly excessive, and highly incompetent. Don’t expect any of the legendary Rajasthani/Gujarati hospitality in which they force food down your throat till you are ready to throw up. Here, you’ll have to vie for the attention of the staff which seems really busy doing nothing.  On a positive note, the food was acceptable. Some parts were very good, some avoidable, but on the whole decent, and with enough choice to keep everybody happy.  Overall, I’d avoid this place, unless you are really craving Gujarati food and can’t seem to find any alternative in Delhi (and there really are very choices to be honest). Final word of caution: this is not an infant-friendly place at all, so if you are going out in the hope of a comfortable meal with a small baby, this is definitely not the place to go.",0

I was expecting a light berry flavor, but I would compare the flavor of this tea to the taste of FIG-- and it is a very strong fig flavor & scent. I have always loved Stash brand teas, and the quality and value of their products are exceptional. However, if you are not a big fan of fig, or are looking for a tea that has a berry/acai flavor, I would not recommend this one. Instead, I suggest you try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D4IX36"">Stash Premium Pomegranate Raspberry Green Tea, Tea Bags, 100-Count Box</a> It has much more of the flavor I was expecting when I ordered this.

They were probably sitting in a hot sweaty warehouse and management needed to move the product, thus the great sale price!<br /><br />I'm giving it 2 stars for the great buy and the fact I didn't get sick.  After reading the freshness dates of the 2 cases, I noticed it was set to expire in 2 months from the day I recieved it. I'm gonna chaulk this up as an old batch.

The chicken chowmein we ordered was overcooked, sticky and lumpy.  The parantha's were ok, although pretty high priced for just two.

Shouldn't they have shut down if they were anticipating major works? Perhaps the only joint which permits you to smoke inside the main hall, albeit in a corner covered with a screening board that does nothing to filter the smoke. The service was attentive, as they ought to have been, we being the only customers throughout.

89,2.0,"I hate to write a bad review for something, but after buying this product based on all the positive reviews, I have to share my experience.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I did not have the wonderful results that many of the other reviewers have described. I purchased Blue Buffalo after doing some research on my current food (Science Diet, Healthy Coat Formula) and deemed that it must be a superior product. I've heard that SD is full of fillers, byproducts and unhealthy whatnots. Everyone bragged how their cats loved Blue Buffalo and became much healthier, happier, and prettier. This was not the case with my 1 year old Calico, Olivia. Not only does she hate it, but her coat is noticeably less attractive and she is shedding probably 10 times more than she did on SD. She's also lost weight because she hasn't been eating as much. She is a very petite lady, so she doesn't need to lose any weight. She's hungry, because come feeding time (twice daily) she runs up eagerly awaiting to be fed, but when she sees that it is not her ""brand"" she sticks her nose up at it. Granted I wasn't expecting miracles, but this has been a bit of a disappointment. I guess it's just not for every kitty.<br /><br />I'm not saying you should go out and buy SD, that is not the purpose of this review, but I do want you to hear another side of this before you buy a large bag of BB.",0

100,3.0,"Interestingly, even when comparing with other sauces, this immediately brought to mind Taco Bell.  I never realized their sauces were so distinctive.<br /><br />With regard to the sauce itself, the consistency is thick, tasting like a mayonnaise base with some BBQ Sauce added and then mixed with some chipotle (minus the seeds). Mildly warm, extremely creamy... certainly not bad... more like comfort food - what you would grab in the middle of the night, not what you would feed to honored guests.<br /><br />So... it fills the bill for standard fare, but would be just as easy to make your own and cut down some of the fat and salt (of which this sauce has a ton of both!!!) and pick up some extra flavor and ""freshness"".

Lots more, actually. That's right, lot more, of the miserly portions of the starters which were served. Everything was tiny, miniaturized, half the expected portion, twice the cost. The chicken pieces on grill were an embarrassment, the dim sums didn't taste of much, the sushi was priced like gold, ( 900 rupees for two pieces?) and tasted of nothing, and I mean nothing.  The bomb will hit you when you start on the mains. The portions were generous. So were the red hot chillies. And I mean RED.HOT. We had guests for interior Maharashtra, who can handle the strongest of chilies, and they were left in tears. Everything, yes, every last thing (bowl of Sole with Sticky Rice) was totally immersed in them. Many of us had tears flowing, and I took two bites of my Lamb with Sticky rice, and then left it.

So people had to literally fight each other to get access to the dishes. The managment claims that expansion is on and soon there will be more space.  The non-vegetarian dishes are good. But the same cannot be said for the vegetarian dishes. In case you are vegetarian, you can give the restaurant a miss. Not even one unique dish to speak about. The soup and salads are ordinary. The service is good. There are sufficient waiters to provide service and they are efficient. The restaurant is well known and attracts huge crowd. ""Butter Chicken"" is their signature dish and it is good. So if you are a non-vegetarian, do go once.",0

The other three gave it their licked-clean food bowl seal of approval.<br /><br />The cans are small (the ""mini"" can size much like Fancy Feast) which is a good match for single cat households since you don't have to deal with leftovers. The smell is much better than the low-cost can foods, and about on a par with the more premium brands such as Hills. The chicken pot pie was VERY watery, however - more like a soup than a stew. The sesame chicken was a bit more solid. The watery nature of the product also makes it messy to serve. To me, it's not a very good value especially considering that you're paying for a lot of water.<br /><br />I don't think I'd get this again given the cost and the mess factor, plus the fact that  there are several other brands that provide top-notch nutrition at a lower cost (and less mess).

My vet and I had run out of ideas to try; nothing seemed to be working for any length of time; hospitalization, IV's, all kinds of meds, etc. and I was desperate! I even stayed home from work with her because I was sure she was not going to make it through that day. It was horible, but I didn't give up even though family members hinted around the suggestion of putting her down. After researching everything I could think of, I stumbled on the thought that maybe her diet was the culprit. I began to search for a food that would fit all the criteria for all of her problems, and found Newman's Chicken & brown rice formula.

Sadly, this mix is kind of blah...it is not bad but not anything better than what I buy at the supermarket. I like cocoa that is rich, mildly sweet with a hint of saltiness. I did not find this mix rich at all (yes, I followed the directions) and did not detect any salt, it was mildly sweet--maybe minimally would be more accurate. Perhaps, after trying it a couple more times the taste will grow on me? I will say it does have a uniqueness about it. All and all, I have to say that I would not suggest this product.",0

We came late in the afternoon (about 4pm) so understood that the service took a little longer (the poor waiter had to climb 2 flights of stairs!). It was relaxing to look out over the crazy streets and we enjoyed some great thali and a paneer kadai, with a good masala tea. The owner asked about our plans when we left but was friendly and cool. We told him our plans and he didn't try to change them and said he hoped we enjoyed our trip - nice guy!",1

Normal water is offered without our asking for it. We loved their porcini risotto and a very delicious quinoa salad. Also good were their chilled glass noodles and chicken meatballs. We washed it all done with some really great throat warming sangria, followed by an excellent tiramisu.The only drawback are the chairs which are hard and difficult to lean back on.

159,4.0,"I decided to try this shampoo as I regularly hi-light my hair.  To start, I'm a little skeptical over any shampoo that claims to be for damaged or color treated hair but isn't sulfate-free.  Regardless.... I like my shampoo to lather and I have found that when I actually use sulfate-free shampoo I don't notice any difference in the life of my hi-lights, and I end up wasting it because I keep trying to get it to lather by putting more and more in my hair (to no avail).<br /><br />Regarding this shampoo - I liked it and I'll buy it again.  The shampoo has a pleasant smell - it's not too strong as others have noted.  And once you rinse it out, it's about the same as any other shampoo.  I almost wish it had a stronger smell as I enjoy the smell of clean/fresh hair.  It didn't do anything mind-blowing-ly awesome to my hair, but it was nice.  A rich lather, a pleasant smell, and I will note - blow drying my hair was fast and less frizzy than normal.  I've noticed with the use of some other shampoos claiming to be for damaged hair, it takes me longer to blow dry my hair, which in turn, causes it to get frizzier.  Not with this shampoo - blow drying was fast, and for the most part, my hair has remained pretty flat all day (and I live in South Florida - so I know a thing or two about humidity).<br /><br />Overall, a good product that I would use again and recommend.  I can't give it 5 stars, simply for the fact that it claims to be for color-treated/damaged hair, yet contains sulfates.",1

The single size is nice because it's easier to do portion control than counting out chips into a plastic baggie.<br /><br />Still on the fence if I would order again, but that's because of calories, not taste.

Purina has all but left the cat food buyer in peril with cheap ingredients, some which are downright awful.

Luckily, the gross ""by-products"" are minimal and there are no grains or wheat gluten in this formula.<br /><br />Fancy Feast is on sale all the time at either Target or my grocery store. In my experience, cans of Fancy Feast Chicken Classic from Walmart are more watery than cans I buy at other retailers. When I began buying this food, the differences in the look of the pate and the content from store A and content from WM were unmistakable. It's not that the food was bad, but it was definately more watery. I've been told Purina makes special batches with less meat content for major discounters. Perhaps WM is one of them.<br /><br />The top six ingredients in this the Chicken Classic formula are; chicken, chicken broth, liver, meat by-products, fish, and poultry by-products. This ingredient list beats any other Fancy Feast formula on the shelves so I recommend it. I take one star off my rating because of the two types of gross by-products in the formula.",1

Ideally the Mumbai Vada Pao is more inclined on the Garlic side but this had a nudge of Delhi Flavours surely needs improvement.  - Ragda Patties - It was aaloo tikki essentially made in curd, green chutney and sweet tamarind sauce.  A great starter though a bit heavy on the tummy because of all the curd put into it. - Cheesy Mushroom Poppers – They tasted as they ideally should. I already knew the flavours of quite famous dish. Tastes fantastic when consumed while they are served hot. - Alfredo Chicken Tikka was a yummy as ever. The best Chicken Tikka is have ever had, we could not stop ourselves from showering praises about the dish in front of the chef. A must try. - The half half (Veg/Non Veg) pizza was great too - Herb Marinated Grilled Chicken pasta lacked taste because the paste was less gravy which got less flavours into the pasta The mocktails were great.

We are hard core non vegetarian, but wanted to try the Burmese cuisine and we were not disappointed. Wide range of food menu with Burmese name with proper description of the dish in English. The attendants are knowledgeable about the dish and can describe nicely with great patience for the 1st timers. We had ordered, a clear veg soup with lotus stem. Very refreshing in cold evening. In starter Hyar YOE KYAW- Lotus stem crisp was amazing. It seems like toasted stems. The dip was also great. In fact each of the dips on table was great. Mopi Salai- its pan fried rice dumplic topped with shredded papaya salad was super tasty. You will ask for more. In main course, we had Puksey- it is steamed bun- with onion and roasted chili filling. It looked somewhat similar to Stuffed Pao. Buns were super soft however the filling was not that great. Had ordered the authentic sticky rice with caramalised onion filling wrapped in banana leaf. It looked great. The rice cake was good but the onion filling was similar to the bun filling.  Finally we ordered the Farota with chickpea vermicelli sabzi. I do not remember the Burmese name. It was similar to lachha or malabari parota. Handmade Vermicelli made from besan. It was very much traditional which our grannies use to prepare handmade sewai with maida or besan dough rolled between the fingers. It was very tasty and went well with the Parota. The flat noodles were different to what we get in India as Chinese food. There was peanut and best part is they serve it with varieties of crisps like crispy onion fry, crushed peanut, crispy arlic, chopped spring onion and lemon. These toppings make the noodles unique.  Dragon fruit cool drink was very aromatic with some floral scent.

Since I was literally starving as it was quite late, the manager offered tea and pickles which I appreciated, considering also that dimsum need around 20 minutes to be ready. Following, we had nice and tasty chicken soup which almost filled me. Then we ordered 3 different kind of dimsum: prawn, chicken in 4 spices and juicy chicken.

It's quaint, lively and unadorned in a way that many cosmopolitan restaurants in the city try so hard to emulate but get wrong for trying too hard. I've eaten there three times now and haven't been disappointed once. Their sea food is fresh and well-prepared. Their steaks are delicious especially in a country that makes steak (not buffalo) hard to find. And the pork belly is yum. If you're on the terrace on a cool winter's night, I challenge you to find another place as charming and so secluded in a residential neighbourhood. They're still finding their feet with perfecting the dishes, but when its packed as often as it is, that's to be expected of a new restaurant. To top it all off, you have an owner in the form of the graceful Naina who adds a pleasing personal touch by talking to her guests, serving drinks and food and carting a blackboard around with the menu to make people feel welcome and at ease. In Delhi, humility is a rare find and when it comes with a winning smile, good service and reasonable prices (considering what passes for the average bill in establishments like this) I'm glad it's my local bistro.

198,4.0,"When I bought this product I was concerned that it contained just a few candy items. Not the case! The amount you see in the image is probably not even a good representation of what you're getting. Although some of your favorites might be missing, it's a good walk down memory lane.<br /><br />The husband of the receiver of this gift liked it so much he was going to buy another later in the year for his sister. It was a definite hit, and they're still eating the candy.",1

205,5.0,"From start to finish everything was excellent, great service, fantastic food and impeccable service. We ate the degustation menu paired with wine. The bacon wrapped prawn with wasabi cream was a stand out for me as was the dessert. A great end to a long weeks work. Highly recommended!",1
206,5.0,"I wasn't very certain what to expect when they kept pushing 'healthy' and 'fiber' and the such in the description.  I figured it was good for me, but might have to choke down a handful to get the benefits.  Glad to say that Kind came out with a rather tasty granola without much in the way of fillers.<br /><br />The flavor is cinnamon, but it doesn't overwhelm the granola/grains. If anything, it's mild and more of an 'aftertaste' (if that can be a positive review).  It hits your tongue more after you're chewing than before and it's definitely not artificial.  The granola is more of a 'softer' kind than I've come across (probably because of the brown rice) so it's not as if you're chewing on rocks and a welcome change.  It goes very well with yogurt since it's not too strong of a flavor and it does make a good cereal.  Since there are less sweetners (molasses and cinnamon seem to be it), you get more granola per serving than others I've noticed (1/3 a cup compared to 1/4) but it still has a great taste (i.e. not cardboard).<br /><br />Definitely will keep a bag on hand for punching up yogurt or for a healthy snack.  Also, it claims to be gluten-free (I'm not an expert on this), which is a nice option to have on hand for anyone who has gluten allergies.",1

208,5.0,Me and my daughter visited for dinner and was offered a range of vegan dishes. The manager understood that we couldn't eat dairy and even made us the most creamiest vegan Korma! The service was excellent and it was nice to see the managers training the wait staff. They told us that they've only been open 10 months and are getting their drink licence soon. If you visit delhi definitely eat here because the food is amazing and you're helping change young people's lives,1
209,5.0,"Rooibos tea has been used for centuries in South Africa.  Not only does it taste really great, it is also good to help induce sleep AND it works to help calm an aching stomach and abdomen.  Whenever me or my kids complain of that good ole *stomach ache*, I immediately brew them a cup.  You can also reuse the Kcup a second time, and even a third though the third will be a little weak, making this a great bargain.  Off topic of the Rooibos, the mint tea can also be used twice in the machine with very little difference in taste.  Both can be used on the largest setting with no loss of taste.  I highly recommend this tea both for it's lovely unique taste AND its medicinal properties.  Enjoy!",1
210,5.0,"We needed a high quality wet cat food to help our sick kitty get his appetite back, put on some weight, and get him into recovery. He had turned up his nose at a great many foods, including the expensive Rx stuff from the vet we were told no cat could resist. Well, Sylvester gave it a definite 4 paws down.  Then we discovered Wellness Chicken Formula Grain Free wet cat food. Sylvester loves this food. He is looking healthier, his coat is shiny, he is friskier and more playful, and all around seems a much happier cat. He meows for his food and races to his bowl when it is feeding time. I have ordered another 2 cases to stock my kitty pantry with this great food.",1

Ideal for lunch gatherings and quick beers before you resume work, good for dates as well.",1
215,5.0,"Apart from the tasteful ambience, the most striking thing you'll notice is their menu - they do not serve any of the regular South Indian fare (idly n dosas n all). Just take the pain to go through their menu in detail, pore over the dish descriptions and/or take assistance from their superb, courteous, knowledgeable staff to know what to order. We relied on the staff and the food was amazing.  A must try, I am definitely coming back.",1
216,5.0,"I've been using Sleepytime to relax at night.  No real problems sleeping but it did help me shut down.  I saw the ""Extra"" and thought I would give it a try.  Same good sleepy affect but I started having dreams, lots of very long lasting dreams about all kinds of stuff.  Nothing scary, some are replays of things in the past some are fantasy like assaulting a meidieval fortress over and over until I get it right.  I don't think I dream normally, at least I don't remember them if I do, but with the Sleeptime Extra I almost always have very vivid dreams and it really is an enjoyable way to spend the night.  No adverse affects as far as I can tell, well except for run on sentences I suppose!",1

221,5.0,"Although my daughter Miriam and I laughingly call it the Pahar-grunge, truly the Pahar ganj is the only place to stay when in Delhi.  We always eat in the Malhotra as do many tourists, locals, and our Kashmiri friends in Delhi. We have never gotten sick there after numerous visits over time. Excess oil and spices sometimes make weary travelers ill instead of real bacterial presence. This could be the reason for isolated complaints about some eating establishments. If one is overtired or overheated, sometimes it is best to cozy up in one´s room with an apple, some natural yoghurt, a few chopped nuts, and a sprinkle of raw quick oats. The food is clean and quickly served, considering the area of town and the constant busy nature of the cafe. This is real North indian food, and can be spicy or toned down if requested. The steaming crusty nan is a must, as are the lamb curries. There are some items that would be satisfactory for the vegetarians in your party, and some salad-ish dishes, too. Downstairs has funky wooden benchstyle tables, while upstairs is reminiscent of better dining rooms. We prefer downstairs where the action is with access to the crazy street fun, just in case a cow comes careening by! The wait staff is efficient and patient with foreigners. The place can be quite full at meal times, so plan accordingly. PS: I seem to recall some kind of fruit and nut dessert that my dear Manzoor always orders when treating a group of friends in the Malhotra.",1

They should keep more variety of beer specially in summers. Overall a very delightful experience. good ambiance, good food and excellent service. A must visit place even for non vegs for a change",1

The pieces are 1 x 1 squares, about 3/4 of a centimeter thick.  They smell like fruity beef bullion to me even though the formula says it is chicken.  I have a Bichon Frise (5 yrs old) and he likes these treats.  The texture reminds me of a Lara Bar but just a tad firmer/dryer.",1
