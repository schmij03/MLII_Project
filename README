# Final Project: NLP with TripAdvisor Data

This repository contains the final project for Machine Learning II, focusing on Natural Language Processing (NLP) using data from TripAdvisor.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to perform NLP analysis on TripAdvisor data. TripAdvisor is a popular online platform that provides user-generated reviews and opinions about travel destinations, accommodations, restaurants, and more. By leveraging NLP techniques, we aim to gain insights and extract valuable information from the textual reviews available on TripAdvisor.

## Data
The project utilizes data collected from TripAdvisor. The dataset consists of reviews from various travel-related entities, such as hotels, restaurants, attractions, and more. Each review includes textual content and additional metadata, such as ratings, dates, and user information. The data will serve as the foundation for our NLP analysis.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the TripAdvisor dataset used for the analysis.

## Usage
To reproduce the project results or further explore the NLP analysis, follow these steps:

1. Acquire the TripAdvisor dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the Jupyter notebooks in in sequential order. These notebooks cover data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and NLP modeling.
3. Review the generated reports in the `reports/` directory for visualizations, findings, and summaries.

## Dependencies
The project utilizes the following Python libraries and frameworks:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- NLTK
- spaCy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- os
- and more

Make sure to install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` before running the notebooks.

## Conclusion
Through this project, we aim to leverage NLP techniques to gain insights from TripAdvisor data. By analyzing user reviews, we can extract valuable information about travel destinations, accommodations, and restaurants, allowing us to make informed decisions and recommendations.
